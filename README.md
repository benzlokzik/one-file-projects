A collection of minimal, single-file scripts and micro-projects I wrote myself, each living in its own language-specific folder under `src/` and following a strict "one file, one command" philosophy.

## ü§ù Contributing

1. **Add your script**
   Place your standalone file in the appropriate folder under `src/`.
2. **Document it**
   Add a row to the **Scripts Index** table above (name, language, one-liner, usage).
3. **Follow style**

   * Use a shebang (`#!/usr/bin/env ...`) for interpreted scripts.
   * Highly desirable to implement `-h|--help` flag for usage instructions.
   * Stick to standard library (zero external deps).
4. **Submit a PR**
   CI will lint, test, and smoke-check your script automatically.
